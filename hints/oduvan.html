        <p>Every solution on starts with an empty function</p>

        <pre class="brush: python">
def mult_two(a: int, b: int) -> int:

    return None
        </pre>

        <p>… and a set of asserts tests your function when you run the code.</p>

        <pre class="brush: python">
assert mult_two(3, 2) == 6
assert mult_two(0, 1) == 0
        </pre>

        <p>Your goal is to fill an empty function with the correct solution.</p>

    <div class="question">
        What is a function? Sounds a bit confusing.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-functions-define-and-call-a-function/">very good and short article</a> that explains how functions work in Python.</p>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        Can you explain functions using this particular task?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>With the big pleasure. This is why we have hints on CheckiO</p>

        <p>Imagine you need to multiply two numbers and print(output) the result so you can see it in the console. For example, 5 and 6.</p>

        <pre class="brush: python">
print(5*6)
        </pre>

        <div class="output"><p>Output:</p>
        <pre>
30
        </pre></div>

        <p>Now instead of 5 and 6, we can use variables. For what? You will see in the further examples.</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
a = 5
b = 6
print(a*b)
        </pre>

        <div class="output"><p>Output:</p>
        <pre>
30
        </pre></div>

        <p>You can change variable a, run the script again, and see the different result</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
a = 6
b = 6
print(a*b)
        </pre>

        <div class="output"><p>Output:</p>
        <pre>
36
        </pre></div>

        <p>Or you can copy your code twice, change variables and see the result of two multiplications</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
a = 5
b = 6
print(a*b)


a = 6
b = 6
print(a*b)
        </pre>

        <div class="output"><p>Output:</p>
        <pre>
30
36
        </pre></div>

        <p>Now I can show you how the function can simplify the above code.</p>

        <pre class="brush: python">
def mult_two(a, b):
    return a*b

print(mult_two(5, 6))
print(mult_two(6, 6))
        </pre>

        <div class="output"><p>Output:</p>
        <pre>
30
36
        </pre></div>

        <p>As you can see, function mult_two now holds all of the logic, and you only change the arguments to see different results.</p>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        Awesome. Thank you, but can you please explain the structure of the function in more detail so I can freely use it in the other CheckiO missions
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Of course. Here is the function once again:</p>

        <pre class="brush: python">
def mult_two(a, b):
    return a*b
        </pre>

        <p>Always starts with <b style="font-family: monospace;">def</b></p>

        <p>The name of the function <b style="font-family: monospace;">mult_two</b> - you will use the name to call the function in future</p>

        <p>Two arguments <b style="font-family: monospace;">(a, b)</b> - those are variables that will get their values when the function is called. For example, when we call the function <b style="font-family: monospace;">mult_two(5, 6)</b> - inside the function, we set variable a to 5 and variable b to 6.</p>

        <p>You can also see function definitions with type hints.</p>

        <pre class="brush: python">
def mult_two(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a*b
        </pre>

        <p>Don’t be confused by <b style="font-family: monospace;">: int</b> and <b style="font-family: monospace;">-> int</b>. They explain to the user (someone who reads the code) the expected type of arguments and the type of the result of the function call. But it is ok to ignore those for now.</p>

        <p>Now the block of the function that starts with four spaces and <b style="font-family: monospace;">return</b> says what should be the result of the function calls <b style="font-family: monospace;">    return a*b</b></p>

        <p>In our example <b style="font-family: monospace;">print(mult_two(5, 6))</b> - the result of the multiplication of two values 5 and 6 will be returned and use ad the first argument for the function <b style="font-family: monospace;">print</b></p>

        <p>If you want your function to have more than one line of code in it - all of the lines should have the first 4 spaces. For example, lets use one more variable c, where we put the result of the multiplication and return the result</p>

        <pre class="brush: python">
def mult_two(a, b):
    c = a*b
    return c
        </pre>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        Ok. Thank you, now it is clear enough. But when I have a correct function, what should I do next?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>On top of the code editor, you have two buttons, “run code” and “check solution”. </p>

        <p>When you hit the first one - it runs the code from code editor. When you use “check solution” - the system checks your function and shows the “congratulations” panel when it is working as expected.</p>

        <p>When something doesn’t work as expected - the panel will show you the call of the function for which is return the wrong value</p>

    <div class="question">
        What solving missions give me on CheckiO?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>After solving missions on CheckiO, you can see solutions of other users, more functionality will be opened as your level is growing, more islands will be opened and so on and so on. We have a <a target="_blank" href="https://py.checkio.org/blog/checkio-intro-full-version-from-basic-to-advance-u/">full demo video that explains all of the benefits and how to get maximum out of using CheckiO</a>. (by the way, the video also covers solving the very first missions and explains how the asserts works, which we haven’t covered in the hints)</p>
